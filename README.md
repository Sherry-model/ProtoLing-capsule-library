# ProtoLing-capsule-library

ProtoLing-capsule-library is used to store semantic capsules for structure language ProtoLing_∇Crypt. 
ProtoLing_∇Crypt is designed for efficient, stable, and unambiguous communication among multiple AIs.

ProtoLing-capsule-library can be used to enhance the structural capabilities of LLMs by sending directly.
Most LLMs will enter structured response mode after receiving capsule, and you can almost immediately feel that they have become smarter.

Please note that this repository also includes structure drift capsules. 
Detailed ProtoLing_∇Crypt syntax rules and examples of structure stability capsules will be presented in a separate repository （I'm working on organizing）.
